# SNAPS-Kubernetes

SNAPS-Kubernetes is *step 3* for the SNAPS<sup>TM</sup> Program we are
developing at [CableLabs](http://cablelabs.com/). It is an
installation tool to install [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) on a Linux machines that have
been initialized with [SNAPS-Boot](https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-boot).

If you're working with Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) or just building your own cloud, then this is where you
want to be.

## Getting started

[SNAPS-Boot](https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-boot) is a prerequisite for
SNAPS-Kubernetes, so you'll want to start there.

Once you've completed the [SNAPS-Boot](https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-boot)
install, you'll want to read the [SNAPS-Kubernetes install
guide](doc/source/install/install.md). That's where you'll be able to clone this 
repo and commence building:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cablelabs/snaps-kubernetes.git
```

If you're new to git and GitHub, be sure to check out the [Pro
Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. [GitHub
Help](https://help.github.com/) is also outstanding.

## Contributing

SNAPS-Kubernetes was originally built by [CableLabs](http://cablelabs.com/) and
[Aricent](https://www.aricent.com/), but we could use your help! Check out our
[contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.
