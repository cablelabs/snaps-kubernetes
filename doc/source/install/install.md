## 3 Deployment View and Configurations

Project SNAPS-Kubernetes is a Python based framework leveraging
Ansible playbooks, Kubespray and a workflow Engine. To provision your
baremetal host, it is recommended but not required to leverage SNAPS-Boot.

![Deployment and Configuration Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/cablelabs/snaps-kubernetes/images/install-deploy-config-overview-1.png?token=Al5dreR4VK2dsb7h6D5beMZmWnkZpNNNks5bTmfhwA%3D%3D)

### 4.8 Networks

SNAPS-Kubernetes supports following 6 solutions for cluster wide networking:

- Weave
- Flannel
- Calico
- MacVlan
- SRIOV
- DHCP

Weave, Calico and Flannel provide cluster wide networking and can be used as
default networking solution for the cluster. MacVlan and SRIOV on the other hand
are specific to individual nodes and are installed only on specified nodes.

SNAPS-Kubernetes uses CNI plug-ins to orchestrate these networking solutions.

#### Default Networks

Parameters defined here specifies the default networking solution for the
cluster.

SNAPS-Kubernetes install the CNI plugin for the network type defined by
parameter `networking_plugin` and creates a network to be consumed by Kubernetes
pods. User can either choose weave, flannel or calico for default networking
solution.

*Required:* Yes

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| networking_plugin | N | Network plugin to be used for default networking. Allowed values are weave, contiv, flannel, calico, cilium (*** does not work***) |
| service_subnet | N | Subnet to be used for Kubernetes service deployments (E.g. 10.241.0.0/18) |
| pod_subnet | N | Subnet for pods networking (E.g. 10.241.64.0/18) |
| network_name | N | Default network to be created by SNAPS-Kubernetes. Note: The name should not contain any Capital letter and “_”. |
| isMaster | N | The default route will point to the primary network. One of the plugin acts as a “Master” plugin and responsible for configuring k8s network with Pod interface “eth0” “isMaster should be True for one plugin.” Value: true/false |

#### Multus Networks

Multus networking solution is required to support application pods with more
than one network interface. It provides a way to group multiple networking
solution and invoke them as required by the pods.

SNAPS-Kubernetes supports Multus as a CNI plugin with following networking
providers:

- Weave
- Flannel
- SRIOV
- MacVlan
- DHCP

#### CNI

List of network providers to be used under Multus. User can define any
combination of weave, flannel, SRIOV, Macvlan and DHCP.

##### CNI Configuration

Parameters defined are specifies the network subnet, gateway, range and other
network intrinsic parameters.

> **Note:** User must provide configuration parameters for each network provider specified under CNI tag (mentioned above).

Go to directory `{git directory}/snaps-kubernetes/snaps_k8s`

Modify file `k8s-deploy.yaml` for provisioning of Kubernetes nodes on cloud
cluster host machines (Master/etcd and minion). Modify this file according to
your set up environment. Refer to section 3.3.

#### 5.1.3 Installation

Ensure build server has python 2.7 and python-pip installed and the user account executing iaas_launch.py must has passwordless sudo access on the build server and must has their ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub injected into the 'root' user of each host machine.

Setup the python runtime (note: it is recommended to leverage a virtual
python runtime especially if the build server also performs functions
other than simply executing snaps-kubernetes):

```Shell
pip install -r {path_to_repo}/requirements-git.txt
pip install -e {path_to_repo}
```

Ensure all host machines must have python and SSH installed, which should
be already completed if using snaps-boot to perform the initial setup.
(i.e. apt-get install -y python python-pip)

Run `iaas_launch.py` as shown below:

```Shell
python {path_to_repo}/iaas_launch.py -f {absolute or relative path}/k8s-deploy.yaml -k8_d
```

This will install Kubernetes service on host machines. The Kubernetes
installation will start and will get completed in ~60 minutes.

> Note: if installation fails due to Error “FAILED - RETRYING: container_download | Download containers if pull is required or told to always pull (all nodes) (4 retries left).” please check your internet connection.

Kubectl service will also be installed on bootstrap node.

After cluster installation, if user needs to run kubectl command on bootstrap
node, please run:

```Shell
export KUBECONFIG={project artifact dir}/node-kubeconfig.yaml
```

### 5.2 Cleanup Kubernetes Cluster

Use these steps to clean an existing cluster.

Go to directory  `~/snaps-kubernetes`

Clean up previous Kubernetes deployment:

```Shell
python iaas_launch.py -f snaps_k8s/k8s-deploy.yaml -k8_c
```
